## JIMMY CHOO OUTLET QUICK VIEW & EASY E-SIGN APP

### OVERVIEW

This is a personal project of mine that I created to do the following:

- Offer in-store clients a digital way to provide their contact information instead of handwriting it (*E-Sign*)
- Send a link to customers requesting to see photos of merchandise as there is no online presence for the outlet division (*Quick View*)
  - Started as a two page web application with two different image gallery sliders and then expanded into a multipage website


**Why did I create this project in the first place?**

I first started with the Easy E-sign application after growing tired of constantly having to ask customers to repeatedly to decipher their handwritten information. Capturing and correctly entering client information into the business's POS software was monitored and graded. Unfortunately, there wasn’t an option to allow customers to digitally input this into the system or offer a sanitary way at the height of covid-19 cleaning procedures. 

As for the Quick View web application, it was created to email out a link to clients as an easy way for them to quickly view what styles were available. It was time consuming to constantly scroll through my phone’s image gallery to find certain images of the store merchandise to share per customer. It dawned on me that it would be easier to put those photos all in one place and share a link for customers to view them if desired. It received overly positive feedback from customers with a highly requested option to browse the items as individual photos of the items instead of a wide angle photo of the product out on display. I took the feedback and changed the webapp into a website that offered customers the ability to navigate across different sections of the multi-paged website to view what exactly they were looking for.

**What did I learn about myself from this project?**

I learned that it takes time and patience to get the results I envisioned when building from the ground up. There were many nights I spent feeling like I didn’t really know what I was doing, but I kept coming back because I wanted to finish what I set out to accomplish. When reaching a feeling of a dead-end, it helped to change gears and work on something else on the project or work on a completely different project to allow time for me to reassess a different approach to the problem at hand.
